# SafeTravel by 6ai

In developing areas, such as parts of India, Philippines, Indonesia, Chili, and Mexico, there is a high risk of danger traveling on public or private transportation for women, children, or other vulnerable people.
Often in these places, women plan their trip with detours to avoid high crime zones or just to have a group of company traveling the same direction. This raises the cost and time consumption of traveling causing the accessible transportation inaccessible.
Thus, safety is a crucial aspect of accessible and sustainable transportation. 

SafeTravel is a mobile app that aims to improve personal safety in public transportation for women, children, elderlies, persons with disabilities, and other vulnerable people.
The app uses machine learning to identify potential danger to the user and automatically alerts friends, family, or local authorities with critical information.
